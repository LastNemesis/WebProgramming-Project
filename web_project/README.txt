This project was created in Advanced Web Programming by:

    - Igor SIVTSEV

All students of the M1-DT class.

> Github link:
    - https://github.com/LastNemesis/WebProgramming-Project

> The functionnalities that were added were:
    - Credidential page
    - Information page (not completed but was originally supposed to help the user use the application)
    - A message indicating that the cell of the Email Table is empty (to avoid undefined problem and for a better visual appreciation)
    - A logo for our application (originally more complex than the one displayed)

> The functionnalities that were asked and 100% completed:
    - Log in with Microsoft Outlook
    - Log out of  Microsoft Outlook (but could not implement a safe guard making sure the user is logged out when leaving the pop-up log-out)

> The functionnalities that were asked and not fully completed:
    - View their email list (only 10 by 10, problem of number of email to display could not be fixed)
    - Specify the number of emails to display (10/20/50 but when changing this value, the table shrink to two value and this could not be fixed)
    - Search for email from a sender (only if the searched sender is in the currently displayed table, the list of 10emails was faulty and the filter could not be applied in time)
    - Search for email by keyword (only if searched keyword is in the currently displayed table)
    - Search for email by date-time (only if searched date-time is in the currently displayed table)
    - Search for eamil by the two latter criteria (if the two input are filled, the table return only if searched keyword (or) date-time is in the currently displayed table)

> The functionnalities that were asked and not at all completed:
    - Displaying the entire content of an email in another page (lack of time)
    - The safe-guard to avoid undefined url if the user tries to access a undefined page

NB: the account used for testing our website did not have sender different than empty. We realized that it was because the emails that we were testing were in fact notes from the Microsoft Application "Sticky-Notes" linked to the microsot account.
Outlook not supporting gmail address when logging in.

PS: we really liked doing this project. It helped us better understand the multiple realition that exist whithin Vue.js and it also helped us working on a web application with an API (in this case, a secure API (with token) which is different than not-secure API).

Thank you.
